    "- **Sensor(s)** : the instrument(s) (also known as hardware(s), software(s), device(s)) used to capture the measurements of some TS phenomena\n",
    "    - **Sensor Readings** : either at a continuous or discrete *time*, it's the process in which the sensor(s) captures and stores measurements\n",
    "        - **Continuous** : *at any time*, we can obtain an observation\n",
    "            - sensor readings occur every second\n",
    "            - of units of time, sensor readings occur at any unit time\n",

    "                - 9.9 secs, mins, days, weeks, months, etc\n",
    "            - will have more data bc sensor readings occur more often\n",
    "        - **Discrete** : we can only obtain an observation *at specific times*\n",
    "            - sensor readings occur greater than every second\n",
    "            - of units of time, sensor readings occur at specific units of time\n",

    "                - 9 mins and 9 secs? yes, but not 9.1 mins and 9.8 seconds\n",
    "                - 25 years 4 months? yes, but not 25 1/2 years and 4 1/2 months\n",
    "             - will have less data bc sensor readings occur less often\n",
    "             \n",
    "- **TS Dataset** : a collection of TS data\n",
    "    - **TS** : data that's an ordered set of observations moving through continuous or discrete time. Stated another way, TS is a collection of observations (measurements with some time component) on some phenomenon.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Observation** : *a single point* along both the x-axis (timestamps) and y-axis (measurements), hence each observation contains a time and some numerical value\n",
    "    - **Observations** : *more than one* **observation**; a list of either entire dataset or sliced between timestamps to get specific measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phenomena** : the observed variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timestamp** : *a single point* in time in which the sensor captured a measurement from the phenomena; x-axis\n",
    "    - **Timestamps** : *more than one* **timestamp**; a list of either entire dataset or sliced between timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Quality** : the condition in which the measurements are presented. $ \\exists $ errors (ie : misreadings, NaN, negative #s when all should be positive)? \n",
    "    - How much data cleaning should we do?\n",
    "    - **Dataset Quality** : the condition in which the dataset itself is presented. What file formats can we load with? Do we have to convert the file format or reduce the size of the file?\n",
    "        \n",
    "- **Measurement** : *a single numerical value* within the observed phenomenon which is a real #; y-axis\n",

    "    - Either continuous or discrete\n",
    "        - **Continuous** : \n",
    "            - There are an **infinite number of possible values between any two values** [5.1g | 24/28];\n",
    "                - has no end\n",
    "            - A phenomenon whose value is *obtained by measuring* - can measure at anytime\n",

    "                - has an end\n",
    "            - The phenomenon has a *countable number* of possible values - can count the specific #\n",
    "            - Counts are nonnegative integers (so ONLY **whole #s**) \n",
