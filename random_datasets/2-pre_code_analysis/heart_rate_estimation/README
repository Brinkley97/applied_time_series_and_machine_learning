Per individual (a total of 15), decompose the time series-based data by two characteristics. There are (1) activity (some are cycling, driving, walking) & (2) duration of activity. With this information, measure with three different sensors the heart rate during that specific duration of time for that specific activity. The average age is 31, race is unidentified but other characteristics (ie : gender, height, weight, etc) are presented.

The main purpose of the dataset is Photoplethysmography(PPG)-based heart rate estimation. Three sensor modalities are used: a) the PPG-sensor itself, b) 3D-accelerometer embedded in the same device as the PPG-sensor, and c) ECG which provides heart rate ground truth.


This dataset is interesting because itâ€™s personalized as in the measurements are specific to that individual for that duration and that activity. Future predictions of heart rate per individual could be made given previous heart rate time series data and current heart rate.
