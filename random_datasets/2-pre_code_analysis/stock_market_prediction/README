A data set based on 5 stock market indexes (ie : S&P 500, NYSE) from 2010 - 2017. It's composed of tracking a range of variables - (1) Close & volume for index as a whole, (2) Companies like Apple, Amazon, etc, (3) many abbreviations that'll require more learning of terms.

There exists missing data so many need to consider interpolation.

Questions/Further Explore
(1) How does each index "close" per day?
(2) Is there a pattern (ie : trend, cyclic) of $$ value for closing?
(3) Is it safe to say current opening = previous closing?
